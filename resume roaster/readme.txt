This is a resume roaster html file.

Initially you would have to download an ollama model and then run the command "ollama serve".

I have use the model called llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_k_m , if you use a different model then replace llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_k_m with that in the code for it to run.

This is a project that I had vibe coded for fun.
